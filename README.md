Abstract
In this paper, we investigated the efficacy of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine using data collected
from the Pfizer vaccine trial from 2020. In particular, we used three avenues of inference to validate/analyze
the Pfizer data, these three methods being: Freuqnetist inference, Bayesian inference, and bootstrapping the 
sampling distribution of vaccine efficacy. In order to see if the Pfizer vaccine
met the FDA standards of at least 30 efficacy, we found point estimates, confidence intervals, and
ran hypothesis tests. Through a skeptical lens, we used an Î± level of 0.01 and found that the
results were robust throughout all methods. In particular, the estimated vaccine efficacy was in
the lower to mid 0.9 range for all three methods and the results were all extremely significant at
the given alpha level. Lastly, from our results we conclude that the experimenters at Pfizer used
an uninformative prior in their analysis
